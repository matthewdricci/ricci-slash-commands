## Checklist

1. **Lingering items?**
   - Is there anything lingering before we end this session?
   - Any half-finished thoughts or uncommitted work?

2. **Jira/Confluence updates?**
   - Do any open updates or thoughts need to be captured in Jira or Confluence?
   - Any issues that should be moved to a different status?

3. **Learnings to capture?**
   - Do any learnings need to be updated in the repository?
   - Anything that should go in global Claude Code settings?

4. **Git status?**
   - Does anything need to be committed?
   - Does anything need to be pushed? (Ask Matt - never push unattended)

5. **Changelog?**
   - Does the changelog need to be updated for https://github.com/matthewdricci/bth-messaging-agent?
   - (Only applies when working in the bth-messaging-agent repo)
